# Minimising Network Detection Probability in MANETs Using Unmanned Vehicles

This article has been written as a project for the <i>"Evolution of Networks"</i> course. The results of our work were presented at the [INTERACT](https://interactca20120.org) conference on Intelligence-Enabling Radio Communications.

Thank you <i>Karol Zientarski, Krzysztof Skoś, Kamil Chełminiak</i> for making this article possible and to our supervisor - <i>Paweł Kułakowski</i> for managing the pure chaos our team sometimes was.

### Abstract

History shows that information is one of the key factors in military conflicts. Therefore there is a need to maintain communication channels on the battlefield. In this document, a simulator that allows to optimise the network to minimise the risk of detection by enemies was created. The simulator, using the Prim’s algorithm and the fine-tuning shows how a mobile ad-hoc network between soldiers aided with unmanned vehicles can become undetectable for enemy units.
